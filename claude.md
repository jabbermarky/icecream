# Ice Ed - Claude Context

## Project Overview
Ice Ed is an ice cream recipe formulation tool. It helps users create balanced ice cream recipes by calculating properties like PAC (freezing point depression), POD (sweetening power), fat content, and more.

## Key Documentation

### Modularization
- **MODULARIZATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed plan for extracting js/app.js into focused modules
- **WORKFLOW.md** - Step-by-step workflow for safe code extraction with testing

### Current Status
- Step 1 complete: Helper functions extracted to `js/utils/helpers.js`
- Next: Steps 2-3 focus on ingredients (JSON data file + module)

## Testing
Run tests before and after any code changes:
```bash
npm test
```

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- HTML/CSS
- Playwright for testing
- USDA FoodData Central API for ingredient data
